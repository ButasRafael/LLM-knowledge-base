# Introduction to Rust

Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. Developed by Mozilla, Rust ensures memory safety without a garbage collector by using a unique ownership model. This model eliminates common bugs found in other languages, such as null pointer dereferencing and buffer overflows.

## Key Features

- **Ownership System:** Guarantees memory safety through compile-time checks.
- **Concurrency:** Provides fearless concurrency with threads and async programming.
- **Performance:** Comparable to C and C++ due to zero-cost abstractions.
- **Tooling:** Comes with Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system, and extensive documentation support.
