# Basics of Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money from users, or disrupting normal business processes. Effective cybersecurity measures are essential for safeguarding personal, organizational, and national data from unauthorized access and malicious activities.

## **Introduction**

In an increasingly digital world, cybersecurity has become paramount for individuals, organizations, and governments. As technology advances, so do the tactics employed by cybercriminals, making it essential to stay informed and implement robust security measures to protect against evolving threats. Cybersecurity not only safeguards sensitive information but also ensures the smooth operation of critical infrastructures and services.

## **Key Concepts in Cybersecurity**

### **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA Triad)**

The **CIA Triad** is a foundational model in cybersecurity that outlines three core principles:

1. **Confidentiality:** Ensuring that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized individuals.
    - **Measures:** Encryption, access controls, and data classification.

2. **Integrity:** Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data.
    - **Measures:** Hash functions, checksums, and digital signatures.

3. **Availability:** Ensuring that information and resources are accessible to authorized users when needed.
    - **Measures:** Redundancy, failover mechanisms, and regular maintenance.

### **Authentication and Authorization**

- **Authentication:** Verifying the identity of a user or system.
    - **Methods:** Passwords, biometrics, and tokens.

- **Authorization:** Granting or denying access to resources based on authenticated identities.
    - **Methods:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Access Control Lists (ACLs), and policies.

### **Non-repudiation**

Ensuring that a party cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a document or the sending of a message that they originated. This is achieved through digital signatures and audit trails.

## **Types of Cyber Threats**

### **Malware**

**Malware** (malicious software) encompasses various types of harmful software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems.

- **Types:**
    - **Viruses:** Attach themselves to legitimate programs and spread to other files.
    - **Worms:** Self-replicate without needing to attach to files.
    - **Trojan Horses:** Disguise themselves as legitimate software to trick users into installing them.
    - **Spyware:** Secretly monitors user activities and collects data.
    - **Adware:** Automatically displays unwanted advertisements.
    - **Rootkits:** Provide privileged access while hiding their presence.

### **Phishing**

**Phishing** is a technique used to deceive individuals into providing sensitive information by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in electronic communications.

- **Types:**
    - **Email Phishing:** Fraudulent emails directing users to malicious websites.
    - **Spear Phishing:** Targeted phishing attacks aimed at specific individuals or organizations.
    - **Whaling:** Phishing attacks targeting high-profile individuals like executives.
    - **Vishing:** Voice-based phishing using phone calls.
    - **Smishing:** SMS-based phishing using text messages.

### **Ransomware**

**Ransomware** is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files, rendering them inaccessible until a ransom is paid. It targets both individuals and organizations.

- **Propagation Methods:**
    - **Phishing Emails:** Malicious attachments or links.

- **Types:**
    - **Volume-Based Attacks:** Overwhelm bandwidth with high traffic.
    - **Protocol Attacks:** Exploit weaknesses in network protocols.
    - **Application Layer Attacks:** Target specific applications or services.

### **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**

**MitM Attacks** involve an attacker intercepting and potentially altering communication between two parties without their knowledge.

- **Techniques:**
    - **Eavesdropping:** Listening to communication channels.
    - **Session Hijacking:** Taking over a user's session.
