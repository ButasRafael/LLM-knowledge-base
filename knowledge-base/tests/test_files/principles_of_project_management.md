## **Introduction**

Project Management encompasses the application of processes, methods, skills, knowledge, and experience to achieve specific project objectives. It is essential across various industries, including construction, information technology, healthcare, and marketing. Successful project management leads to the efficient use of resources, timely completion of tasks, and delivery of high-quality outcomes.

## **Key Principles of Project Management**

### **Define Clear Objectives**
