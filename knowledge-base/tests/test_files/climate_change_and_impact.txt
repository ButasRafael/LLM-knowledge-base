1. Introduction to Climate Change

Climate change encompasses long-term alterations in temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, and other aspects of the Earth's climate system. While natural factors contribute to climate variability, the current trend of rapid warming is predominantly driven by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes.

2. Causes of Climate Change

Greenhouse Gas Emissions:
Carbon Dioxide (CO₂): Released from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and cement production.
Methane (CH₄): Emitted during the production and transport of coal, oil, and natural gas; also from livestock and other agricultural practices.
Nitrous Oxide (N₂O): Produced from agricultural and industrial activities, as well as combustion of fossil fuels.
Fluorinated Gases: Synthetic gases used in industrial applications, with a high global warming potential.

Deforestation:
Impact: Reduces the number of trees that can absorb CO₂, while releasing stored carbon when trees are cut or burned.
Drivers: Agricultural expansion, logging, and urbanization.

Industrial Activities:
Emissions: Factories emit CO₂ and other GHGs through energy consumption and chemical reactions.
Pollutants: Release of pollutants that can affect atmospheric composition and climate.

Agriculture:
Methane Emissions: From enteric fermentation in ruminants and rice paddies.
Nitrous Oxide Emissions: From synthetic fertilizers and manure management.
Land Use: Conversion of land for agriculture leads to deforestation and habitat loss.

3. Greenhouse Effect and Global Warming

The Greenhouse Effect is a natural process where certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat, keeping the planet warm enough to support life. However, excessive concentrations of GHGs enhance this effect, leading to Global Warming—a sustained increase in global average temperatures.

Process:
1. Solar radiation reaches the Earth, passing through the atmosphere.
2. The Earth's surface absorbs the energy and re-emits it as infrared radiation.
3. GHGs absorb and re-radiate some of this infrared energy, warming the atmosphere.
4. The additional trapping of heat leads to an overall rise in temperatures.

4. Evidence of Climate Change

Rising Temperatures:
Global average temperatures have increased by approximately 1.1°C since the late 19th century.
Recent decades have consistently recorded some of the hottest years on record.

Melting Ice Caps and Glaciers:
Significant reduction in ice mass in polar regions and mountain glaciers worldwide.
Contributors to sea-level rise and loss of habitat for species dependent on ice.

Sea-Level Rise:
Global sea levels have risen by about 20 centimeters since 1900.
Increased risk of coastal flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater resources.

Extreme Weather Events:
Increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes, heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall events.
Greater economic and human impacts from natural disasters.

Ocean Acidification:
Oceans absorb about 30% of emitted CO₂, leading to lower pH levels.
Adverse effects on marine life, particularly organisms with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons.

5. Impacts of Climate Change

Environmental Impacts:
Ecosystem Disruption: Altered habitats and migration patterns affect biodiversity.
Loss of Biodiversity: Extinction risks for vulnerable species unable to adapt.

Social Impacts:
Health Risks: Increased heat-related illnesses, spread of vector-borne diseases, and respiratory issues from air pollution.
Displacement and Migration: Rising sea levels and extreme weather events force communities to relocate, leading to climate refugees.

Economic Impacts:
Damage to Infrastructure: Costly repairs and rebuilding after natural disasters.
Agricultural Productivity: Shifts in crop yields due to changing weather patterns, affecting food security.
Cost of Mitigation and Adaptation: Investments required to reduce emissions and adapt to climate changes.

6. Regional Effects of Climate Change
